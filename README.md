# Contoso Cookbook with a little of ReactiveUI

Contoso Cookbook is a classic Microsoft sample recipe app; first adapted for Xamarin.Forms by Jeff Prosise in 2015 and now updated to use Prism for Xamarin.Forms. Demonstrates how to use a TabbedPage with a DataTemplate for the tabs, and a ListView with DataTemplate for the recipe list on each tab; for a clean professional-looking UI.

Taken from https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism-Samples-Forms. Updated to Prism 7.2. Xamarin Forms 4.2 and RxUI 9.19.5

Added login and search for the recipes.
